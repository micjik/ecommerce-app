# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

# packages
  install vite by using "npm create vite@latest". visit website https://vite.dev/ for more details 
  install tailwind using npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite. visit https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite.
  install react-router-dom for your pages: npm install react-router-dom
  install react-simple-typewriter for a nice typewriter effect: npm install react-simple-typewriter
